Its just my school project, a library manager...

there are currently 2 projects here:
    
    - folder poo contais the old project, 600 lines:
        terminal program
        connection to database
        interacts with database
        unfinished >> manages database

    - folder oop contais the new project, under development:
        nothing for now, has all the functions of the old program, but is under development to have a gui available

the project is under development and far from complete
